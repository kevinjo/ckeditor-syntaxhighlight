A plugin for CKEditor (3.x) adding support for Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter.

This is a rewrite/port of the syntaxhighlight plugin for FCKEditor available at: http://psykoptic.com/blog/post/2008/12/01/Code-Syntax-Highlight-Plugin-for-FCKeditor.aspx

I used their dialog layout (and text) and pilfered some of the SyntaxHighlighter class attribute parsing code.
